//There is no polynomial time solution available for this problem as the problem is a known NP-Hard problem.
// There is a polynomial time Greedy approximate algorithm, the greedy algorithm provides a solution which is
// never worse that twice the optimal solution.

//Greedy approach to this problem only works if distance between two points is always smaller than sum of
// distances through a third point.
